					Groot (/ɡruːt/) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Larry Lieber, and Dick Ayers, the character first appeared in Tales to Astonish #13 (November 1960). An extraterrestrial, sentient tree-like creature, the original Groot first appeared as an invader that intended to capture humans for experimentation.
					
					The character was reintroduced as a heroic, noble being in 2006, and appeared in the crossover comic book storyline "Annihilation: Conquest". Groot went on to star in its spin-off series, Guardians of the Galaxy, joining the team of the same name. Groot has been featured in a variety of associated Marvel merchandise, including animated television series, toys, and trading cards. Vin Diesel voices Groot in the 2014 film Guardians of the Galaxy and its 2017 sequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and Krystian Godlewski plays the character via performance capture in the first film. Since his film premiere, Groot has become a pop culture icon, with his repeated line "I am Groot" becoming an internet meme.
