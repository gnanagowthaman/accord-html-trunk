						<h2>Our Mission</h2>
						
						
						<p class="text-justify">We need to have complete certainty that things will work out, not because we are righteous or wise, but because of the time, the effort, the prayers, and the tools we are using. From the moment we are given awareness about some bigger picture or mission, we have to have complete focus on what to do to get to that &nbsp;place. The Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) monitors and measures socioeconomic and macroeconomic trends.
							The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) produces the gross domestic product and related economic measures that provide
							essential information to improve decision-making on such matters as monetary policy, federal and state budget projection,
							allocation of federal funds to states, and trade negotiations. The Census Bureau supports BEA by collecting statistical
							information about the economy. The Census Bureau also provides demographic information about U.S. society by conducting
							regular surveys and Decennial Censuses that are used by federal, state, and local officials and by private stakeholders to make
							important policy decisions. Full implementation of the new American Community Survey (ACS) will in the future provide
							additional annual data—data that will be more detailed and more timely than are available now. The Census Bureau also provides
							official measures of electronic commerce (e-commerce) activity and is evaluating how e-commerce affects existing measures of
							economic activity
						</p>
						<p class="text-justify">Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life; everyone must carry out a concrete assignment that demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated, thus, everyone's task is unique as his specific opportunity to implement &nbsp;it.</p>
